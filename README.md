-App Launch is in review -

This is an investment tracking app for crpyto currency investments. No WEB3 wallet connection is required. Users can keep track of their investment values, the price changes of their coins and get investment anaylsis. 

In this app, I am using Hilt, Room, Remote API and following MVVM Clean Architecture pattern. 

***This app will stay as open-source and everyone is welcomed to contribute.***

- Searching and adding any cryptocurrency to wallet
- Choosing base currency type for their app
- UI refresh with new coin data and currency data every 60 seconds
- Keep track of the current investment
